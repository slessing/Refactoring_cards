# Current status

The set of cards has three categories:
* Code smells
* Refactoring patterns
* Anti-legacy code patterns

The subdirectories are organized with those names.

The basic ideas of the cards is to match apparent or confirmed code smells with possible refactoring patterns or anti-legacy code patterns.
While some code smells can be resolved using one particular pattern, there are some code smells where a variety of patterns or a combination of patterns can be utilized.

Typical code smells for a 1:1 relationship could be:
* TBA

Typical code smells for a 1:n relationship could be:
* TBA
